## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   .NET 8.0 SDK
*   Node.js (v18+)
*   SQL Server

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup (API & Public Site)
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Update `appsettings.json` with your SQL Connection String.
3.  Run migrations:
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
4.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    (Runs on `https://localhost:7150` by default).

### 2️⃣ Admin Panel Setup

    ```bash
    cd admin-panel
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Configure Environment:
    Create `.env` file:

    ```
4.  Start Development Server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## 📦 Deployment (IIS)

This project is optimized for IIS deployment.

### Backend Publish
1.  Run `dotnet publish -c Release`.
2.  Upload files to your server (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`).
3.  **Important:** Ensure `web.config` is present to handle IIS modules.

### Admin Panel Publish
1.  Run `npm run build` inside `admin-panel`.
2.  Upload `dist` folder contents to your admin subdomain or subfolder (e.g., `dashboard.yourdomain.com`).

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting 405/403 Errors on IIS
If you encounter `403 Forbidden` or `405 Method Not Allowed` on **DELETE/PUT** requests:
*   This project includes a built-in **Method Override** feature.
*   The Admin Panel automatically converts `DELETE` and `PUT` requests to `POST` requests with a special header (`X-HTTP-Method-Override`).
*   Ensure the Backend is published correctly, as `Program.cs` contains the middleware to handle this override.
